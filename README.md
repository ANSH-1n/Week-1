Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System
This project is a machine learning-based Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System. The system takes in environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, pH, and other soil-related information to recommend suitable crops for a specific region and provide fertilizer recommendations accordingly.

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed.

Project Description
The objective of this project is to develop a recommendation system that helps farmers choose suitable crops based on specific parameters such as temperature, humidity, pH, and soil content. The system also recommends fertilizers based on these factors, ensuring optimal growth conditions for the selected crop.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "Crop Recommendation" dataset, which contains historical data on various crops, along with environmental parameters, soil quality, and temperature.

Source: The dataset can be found in the "Dataset" folder in the project directory as Crop_recommendation.csv.
The dataset contains several features, such as:

Temperature
Humidity
Ph (pH value)
Rainfall
Soil type
Crop label (The recommended crop)
Code Walkthrough
Step 1: Importing Libraries
The following libraries are imported:

numpy and pandas for data manipulation
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
Step 2: Loading the Dataset
The dataset is loaded using pandas read_csv() function. The dataset file should be placed inside the "Dataset" directory.

python
Copy
crop = pd.read_csv("Dataset/Crop_recommendation.csv")
Step 3: Basic Data Exploration
Several commands are used to explore the dataset, including:

Viewing the first and last 5 rows with crop.head() and crop.tail().
Checking the dataset shape with crop.shape.
Checking for null values and duplicates using isnull() and duplicated() methods.
Descriptive statistics are shown with crop.describe().
Step 4: Data Insights
The dataset's column names can be accessed using crop.columns.
The count of each label (crop type) is displayed with crop['label'].value_counts().
Usage
Once the dataset is loaded and explored, the next steps would typically involve:

Preprocessing the data, handling missing values and outliers.
Feature selection and feature engineering.
Building machine learning models (e.g., classification models).
Evaluating model performance and tuning hyperparameters.
This part can be developed further depending on the final recommendation system logic you aim to implement.
