This project is a machine learning-based Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System, designed to recommend suitable crops and fertilizers based on environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, pH, and soil-related data. The dataset used is the "Crop Recommendation" dataset, which includes features like temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall, soil type, and crop labels. The project provides an interactive interface for exploring the dataset, visualizing features, and filtering data for specific crop analysis. It also allows for downloading the processed dataset. The code includes importing necessary libraries, loading the dataset, exploring the data, and offering various visualization and filtering options. You can also contribute to the project by forking the repository, making changes, and submitting a pull request. This project is licensed under the MIT License.
